# Art Model Documentation

## Purpose

The Art model represents a creative practice or skill that can be learned, practiced, and mastered by users. It serves as the fundamental collection item in the Atlantis Go "Pok√©dex" system, allowing users to discover, collect, and master different types of human creative endeavors.

## Schema

## Relationships

| Relationship | Type | Related Model | Through | Description |
|-------------|------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| taxonomy | Many-to-One | ArtTaxonomy | taxonomy_id | Categorization of the art |
| parent_arts | Many-to-Many | Art | self-referential | Arts that are prerequisites for this art |
| child_arts | Many-to-Many | Art | parent_arts (reverse) | Arts that have this art as a prerequisite |
| parts | One-to-Many | ArtPart | art_id (reverse) | Components or aspects of the art that must be practiced |
| stages | One-to-Many | ArtStage | art_id (reverse) | Different learning stages for the art |
| masteries | One-to-Many | ArtMastery | art_id (reverse) | User mastery records for this art |
| required_for_tech_nodes | Many-to-Many | TechTree | required_arts | Tech tree nodes requiring this art |
| unlocked_by_tech_nodes | Many-to-Many | TechTree | unlocks_arts | Tech tree nodes that unlock this art |

## Patterns

### Creation Pattern

```python
# Create a new Art
art = Art.objects.create(
    name="Poetry",
    description="The art of rhythmical composition for exciting pleasure by imagination or emotion",
    icon="icons/poetry.png",
    banner_image="banners/poetry.jpg",
    difficulty_level=3,
    taxonomy=literature_taxonomy,  # ArtTaxonomy instance
    required_virtues={"wisdom": 20, "temperance": 15},
    improved_virtues={"wisdom": 5, "temperance": 3, "beauty": 4},
    tech_tree_level=2,
    is_unlocked_default=False,
    rank_required=1,
    economic_layer_required="PORT",
    practice_method="SOLO",
    average_mastery_time_days=90
)

# Add parent arts (prerequisites)
art.parent_arts.add(language_art)  # Assuming language_art is another Art instance
```

### Query Patterns

```python
# Get all arts in a specific taxonomy
literature_arts = Art.objects.filter(taxonomy=literature_taxonomy)

# Get all arts available to a user of rank 1
beginner_arts = Art.objects.filter(rank_required=1)

# Get all arts unlocked by default
default_arts = Art.objects.filter(is_unlocked_default=True)

# Get arts that are prerequisites for a specific art
prerequisites = art.parent_arts.all()

# Get arts that have this art as a prerequisite
dependent_arts = art.child_arts.all()

# Get all parts for an art
parts = art.parts.all()

# Get all learning stages for an art
stages = art.stages.all()

# Get all users who are practicing this art
practicing_users = User.objects.filter(art_masteries__art=art)
```

### Deletion Pattern

```python
# When deleting an art, all related objects will be affected:
# - ArtParts will be deleted (CASCADE)
# - ArtStages will be deleted (CASCADE)
# - ArtMastery records will be deleted (CASCADE)
# - Many-to-many relationships will be removed

# Safe deletion with checks
def safe_delete_art(art_id):
    try:
        art = Art.objects.get(pk=art_id)
        
        # Check if this art is a prerequisite for other arts
        if art.child_arts.exists():
            return False, "Cannot delete: this art is a prerequisite for other arts"
            
        # Check if this art is required for tech tree nodes
        if art.required_for_tech_nodes.exists():
            return False, "Cannot delete: this art is required for tech tree progression"
            
        # If safe, delete the art
        art.delete()
        return True, "Art deleted successfully"
    except Art.DoesNotExist:
        return False, "Art not found"
```

## Invariants

4. **Economic Layer Format**: economic_layer_required must be one of "PORT", "LAWS", or "REPUBLIC"
5. **Required Virtues Structure**: required_virtues must be a valid JSON object with virtue names as keys and integer values
6. **Improved Virtues Structure**: improved_virtues must be a valid JSON object with virtue names as keys and integer values

9. **Valid Difficulty**: difficulty_level must be between 1 and 10

## Error States

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint | Attempting to create an Art with a name that already exists | Choose a different name for the art |
| ValueError: practice_method must be one of SOLO, PAIR, GROUP | Invalid practice_method value | Use only allowed values |
| ValueError: economic_layer_required must be one of PORT, LAWS, REPUBLIC | Invalid economic_layer_required value | Use only allowed values |
| ValidationError: Invalid JSON format for required_virtues | Malformed JSON in required_virtues field | Ensure proper JSON format with virtue names as keys and integer values |
| CircularDependencyError | Adding a parent art that creates a circular dependency | Restructure dependencies to avoid circles |
| ForeignKeyViolation | Deleting a taxonomy that arts are using | Reassign arts to a different taxonomy before deletion |
