Add Claude Optimization Layer for improved AI assistance

This commit adds a comprehensive Claude Optimization Layer to the project, creating
a structured metadata framework that enhances Claude's ability to understand and
work with the codebase. This implementation follows the best practices for
AI-optimized repositories.

Key additions:
- Created `.claude/` directory with standardized structure
- Added component dependency graphs in machine-readable format
- Implemented semantic code indexing for the Art System
- Set up debug history database with example entries
- Created pattern libraries for Django model relationships
- Added component-specific cheat sheets for Core User System
- Added Q&A database for common Art System implementation questions
- Created model-friendly documentation for the Art model
- Added delta summaries for Art System implementation changes
- Implemented memory anchors with UUIDs for precise referencing

This layer will significantly improve Claude's ability to assist with development
by providing structured access to codebase knowledge, relationships, and patterns.
