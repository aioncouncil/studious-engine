# Atlantis Go Pattern Library

## Overview

This pattern library documents the core architectural and implementation patterns used throughout the Atlantis Go codebase. It serves as both a reference for implementing new features and a guide for refactoring existing code.

Each pattern document details:
- The purpose and context of the pattern
- Implementation examples with code
- Key considerations for when to use or avoid the pattern
- Uncertainty handling and error recovery
- Performance considerations

## Core Philosophy Patterns

These patterns represent the foundational philosophical concepts that drive the Atlantis Go system architecture.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Matrix Flow](matrix_flow.md) | The four-quadrant lifecycle pattern (Soul Out → Body Out → Soul In → Body In) that structures experiences and personal development |
| [Virtue Metrics Calculation](virtue_metrics_calculation.md) | Patterns for tracking, calculating, and improving the eight core virtues |
| [Experience Progression](experience_progression.md) | Structured patterns for discovering, experiencing, and mastering activities |

## Geographic Patterns

Patterns related to location-based features and zone management.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Zone Geographic Patterns](zone_geographic_patterns.md) | Defining and managing geographic zones with matrix quadrant associations |
| User Location Tracking | Tracking and utilizing user location data effectively |
| Geographic Discovery | Location-based discovery mechanics for zones and experiences |

## Data Model Patterns

Patterns for implementing consistent and maintainable data models.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| UUID Primary Keys | Using UUID fields for primary keys across all models |
| JSON Field Usage | Patterns for effectively using JSON fields for flexible schema |
| Hierarchical Relationships | Self-referential model relationships for hierarchy |
| History Tracking | Tracking historical changes in model data |

## User Progress Patterns

Patterns related to tracking and encouraging user progress.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Mastery Progression | Implementing mastery levels with diminishing returns |
| Discovery Mechanics | Tracking user discoveries and providing incentives |
| Achievement Systems | Defining and awarding achievements |
| XP and Leveling | Experience point accumulation and level progression |

## Service Layer Patterns

Patterns for implementing service-oriented architecture within the system.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Service Objects | Implementing business logic in service objects |
| Recommendation Engines | Building personalized recommendation services |
| Transaction Handling | Managing database transactions for complex operations |
| Event Processing | Processing and responding to system events |

## User Interface Patterns

Patterns for consistent user interface implementation.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Progressive Disclosure | Revealing features and capabilities as users progress |
| Matrix-Based Navigation | Organizing UI navigation based on matrix quadrants |
| Virtue Visualization | Displaying virtue metrics in meaningful ways |
| Map Integration | Integrating maps with zones and experiences |

## Performance Patterns

Patterns that address performance optimization.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Query Optimization | Optimizing database queries for common operations |
| Caching Strategies | Effective use of caching across the system |
| Batch Processing | Processing operations in batches for efficiency |
| Asynchronous Task Processing | Using background tasks for performance-intensive operations |

## Using This Library

### For Developers

1. **When implementing a new feature**, review the relevant patterns first to ensure consistency.
2. **When refactoring existing code**, use these patterns as a guide for improvements.
3. **When debugging issues**, check if the problem is due to pattern misuse or inconsistency.

### For Extending the Library

1. Create new pattern documents using the established template.
2. Reference existing patterns where appropriate.
3. Include concrete code examples that demonstrate the pattern.
4. Document edge cases, uncertainty handling, and performance considerations.
